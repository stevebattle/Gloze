To generate Gloze documentation with ant you need to install Doxygen and its ant task

To run the ant script within eclipse you may need to add the Doxygen task to the classpath.
open build.xml, preferences > select Ant/Runtime, then add ant_doxygen.jar to Ant Home Entries.

To test Gloze with ant you need JUnit <http://www.junit.org>.
